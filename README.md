# Overview
Our goal is to build a new AI model capable of learning from stablished biological data (Amino acid sequences) which sequences are enzymes and which aren't, i.e. we want a classifier in the format of f(amino_acid_sequence) -> enzyme / non-enzyme.

## More information

This project is the implementation for the conclusion work entitled "[Automatic gene annotation with Artificial Intelligence: Binary classification between enzymes and non-enzymes](conclusion_work.pdf)" presented to the course of Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineering as a partial requirement for obtaining the title of Biotechnology and Bioprocess Engineer (2024) for the Federal University of Technology - Paran√°
