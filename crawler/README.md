# Development
To run locally:
```sh
python -m venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## VSCODE
It is a good idea to setup vscode to use the virtual env:
- Python: Select interpreter
- Provide the path to the virtual env, (e.g. ./venv/bin/python) (Beaware of the current root of vscode)
